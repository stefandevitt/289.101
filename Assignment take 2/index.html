   <p><u>Location:</u>
        Rarotonga is the capital island of the Cook Islands, located in the South Pacific Ocean. Avarua is the main town of Rarotonga. There are fifteen major islands in the Cook Islands, which are divided into two distinct groups of coral atolls: The Southern Cook Islands and the Northern Cook Islands. The islands were formed by volcanic activity.</p>
           
        <p><u>Climate:</u> The climate of the Cook Islands is a moderate to tropical climate as severe weatheris seldom experienced, this makes the Cook Islands a destination suitable to visit all year round! The wet weather season is between November and march with an average temperature of 28 degrees celsius, meanwhile the dryer, cooler season is between April and October where the average temperature is 20 degrees celsius. Rarotonga generally experiences a slightly cooler climate in comparison to its neighbouring islands.</p>
        
        <p><u>Infrastructure:</u> There are limited ATM and medical facilities on Rarotonga, also the water is untreated and bottled water is recommended. Mobile phone coverage is available with mobile phones, where sim cards and top-up cards can be purchased and data roaming can be used for tourists. The interior of the island remains largely unpopulated due to forbidding terrain and lack of infrastructure, meaning resorts, tourist hotspots are located on the main road of Ara-Tapu which traces the coast. </p>
        
    
        <p><u>Transport:</u> Visitors to the island who rent motor scooters or cars for local transportation are required to get a Cook Islands driver license. Visitors from Australia, New Zealand, US, Canada, UK and the EU can now drive in the Cook Islands for up to six months using their overseas license. There is a 20-dollar fee for a Cook Islands license and a test for anyone wanting to use a small motorcycle (up to 125cc) that involves written theory and a practical test of driving skills. The island has only two bus services: clockwise and anti-clockwise
