            Rarotonga is the capital island of the Cook Islands, located in the South Pacific Ocean. Avarua is the main town of Rarotonga. There are fifteen major islands in the Cook Islands, which are divided into two distinct groups of coral atolls: the Southern Cook Islands and the Northern Cook Islands. The islands were formed by volcanic activity.</p>
